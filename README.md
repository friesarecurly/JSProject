- Clicking a restaurant shows their best ramen and its nutrition facts
  - Visual affect will be glamorous (if possible)

## Idea #2

- User will use the mouse to activate certain properties

# Architecture & Technology

Not sure what my framework will look like
Will most likely have a csv file holding each food's data
Use reg text first then have something to click for visualizing nutrition facts
